#### Breko-hub

## Features

## Usage

```bash
npm build [TODO]
# production build
# assumes environmental variables
npm start [TODO]
# start the server
# assumes environmental variables

npm run dev
# build and serve with babel-hmr - from .env file
npm test [TODO]
# one time run mocha scripts
```


## Todo

1. include directories into css and scss imports for both modules and non-modules
2. Setup redux on client
3. Setup redux on server with initialState
4. Setup Log and Dock Monitors for redux state
5. Create build config and bundle CSS-modules (no hot loading required)
6. Create start script to fire up server without building
7. Improve routing of private/public routes through react-router
8. Wire up react-router state to webpack (redux react router?)
